# Pair.NET
This is a very short piece of code which implements the functionalities of std::pair (C++) in C#.
It provides a generic class called Pair with two properties to represent the actual values of the items.
Moreover it overrides the "ToString()" method derived from "object" and a static method to create a pair.

The code is licensed under the GNU public license.
