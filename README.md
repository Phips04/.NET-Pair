# .NET-Pair
A very small project, allows you to use a type in .NET similar to std::pair&lt;T, U> in C++

This project includes a generic type (class).
It contains two properties called first and second, they return the values of the pairs members.
The static method "MakePair" takes two values of any type, and returns a pair made up by these values.
Just a few lines of code to keep this very simple, have fun.
