# .NET-Pair
A very small project, allows you to use a type in .NET similar to std::pair&lt;T, U> in C++

This project includes a generic type (class).
It contains two properties called first and second, representing the values of the pairs members.
The static method "MakePair" takes two values of any type, and returns a pair made up by these values.
The virtual ToString() method defined by "object" has been overriden. Just a few lines of code to keep this very simple, have fun.
